SME Product Discovery Case Study

Using SME interviews to define a real product problem and solution

1. Problem Statement

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) often operate with limited tools to manage daily operations, customer engagement, and business growth. Many rely on informal processes, making it difficult to understand customer behavior, manage contacts, and make data-driven decisions.

Core problem:

SMEs lack a simple, centralized solution that supports daily operations while helping them grow and engage customers effectively.
2. Why This Problem Matters

SMEs form the backbone of the economy, yet many:

Struggle to organize customer and business information

Rely on manual or fragmented systems

Have limited visibility into growth opportunities

Solving this problem can improve efficiency, revenue tracking, and customer relationships.

3. Using Data to Support Product Discovery

Before conducting interviews, I prepared a cleaned SME dataset to:

Identify active business categories

Ensure accurate contact information

Select a representative sample of SMEs for interviews

The dataset was not the end product, but a tool to enable better user research and problem validation.

4. User Interviews

Using the cleaned dataset, I conducted interviews across different SME categories such as:

Hair & beauty businesses

Restaurants

Retail and service-based SMEs

Interview focus areas:

Daily operational challenges

Customer communication and engagement

Current tools used (or lack thereof)

Pain points in growth and visibility

5. Key Insights from Interviews

Several recurring themes emerged:

Operational friction
SMEs manage operations manually, leading to errors and inefficiency.

Customer engagement challenges
Many businesses struggle to retain customers or communicate promotions consistently.

Limited digital tools
Existing tools are either too complex or not tailored to SME needs.

6. Refined Problem Statement
Based on user insights:

SMEs need a lightweight, easy-to-use platform that helps them manage operations and engage customers without complexity or high costs.

7. Product Vision

A simple, SME-focused platform that enables:

Business and customer contact management

Daily operational tracking

Customer engagement through basic outreach tools

Actionable insights to support growth

8. MVP Definition
Core MVP Features:

Centralized business & customer contacts

Simple dashboard for daily operations

Basic reporting (activity, customer engagement)

Easy onboarding for non-technical users

Features were prioritized based on user pain points and impact vs effort.

9. Key Product Decisions

Simplicity over feature richness

Mobile-friendly design

Low learning curve

Scalable foundation for future features

10. Next Steps

Validate MVP features with a second round of SME interviews

Build low-fidelity prototypes

Pilot with a small group of SMEs

Iterate based on feedback

11. Role & Skills Demonstrated

Product discovery & problem definition

User research & qualitative interviews

Data-supported decision making

MVP scoping & prioritization

12. Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how data-supported user research can drive meaningful product decisions. By focusing on real SME challenges, the product vision is grounded in validated user needs rather than assumptions.




# SME Audit & Interview Readiness Project

## Overview
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of many economies, yet most digital tools built for them fail due to **poor problem discovery** rather than poor execution.

This project focused on preparing a **clean, interview-ready SME dataset** to support **product discovery, problem validation, and solution design** — not analytics reporting.

The outcome enables structured SME interviews to inform the design of a scalable SME audit and business insights product.

---

## Product Context
As a Product Manager, my objective was **not to analyze SMEs**, but to **understand them**.

Before building:
- An SME audit platform
- A diagnostics or compliance product
- A business health or insights tool

We first needed to ensure:
- The right SMEs were being engaged
- Contacts were reliable
- Categories were clear
- Interviews could be conducted efficiently

This dataset serves as the **foundation for customer discovery**.

---

## Problem Statement
Many SME-focused products fail because:
- Interviews are conducted on poor-quality data
- Business categories are inconsistent
- Contacts are duplicated or invalid
- Outreach is inefficient and biased

**Without clean input data, product discovery produces misleading insights.**

---

## Product Goal
Prepare a **high-integrity SME contact dataset** that enables:
- Accurate SME segmentation
- Targeted interview outreach
- Reliable qualitative insights
- Faster iteration during product discovery

---

## Scope of This Project
This project covers **pre-product discovery groundwork**, specifically:

- Cleaning and standardizing SME business records
- Resolving duplicate and inconsistent contact information
- Normalizing business categories
- Creating a single primary contact per SME
- Producing an interview-ready dataset

 This project does NOT:
- Build a predictive model
- Perform market sizing
- Draw business conclusions

---

## Key Product Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|
| Normalize business categories | Enables SME segmentation for interviews |
| Consolidate contacts | Ensures single point of contact per SME |
| Remove duplicates | Prevents biased interview results |
| Preserve location data | Supports regional analysis in later phases |

---

## Deliverables
- **Cleaned SME interview dataset**
- **Data preparation notebook**
- **Clear audit trail of data decisions**

These deliverables support:
- User interviews
- JTBD discovery
- Problem validation
- MVP definition

## How This Fits Into the Product Lifecycle
This project sits in the **Discovery phase**:

1. ✅ Data preparation for outreach
2. 🔜 SME interviews
3. 🔜 Problem synthesis
4. 🔜 Opportunity definition
5. 🔜 Solution ideation
6. 🔜 MVP design

---

## Next Steps (Planned)
- Conduct SME interviews using this dataset
- Identify recurring operational pain points
- Define core problems worth solving
- Translate insights into product requirements
- Design and validate an MVP

---

## Role & Responsibilities
**Role:** Product Manager  
**Focus:** Product discovery enablement  
**Skills demonstrated:**
- Problem framing
- Data-informed decision making
- User research readiness
- Cross-functional thinking
- Practical product foundations

---

## Why This Matters
Good products start with **good questions**.  
Good questions require **good data**.

This project ensures that when interviews begin, they produce insights worth building on.
