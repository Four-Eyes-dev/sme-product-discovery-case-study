SME Product Discovery Case Study

Using SME interviews to define a real product problem and solution

1. Problem Statement

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) often operate with limited tools to manage daily operations, customer engagement, and business growth. Many rely on informal processes, making it difficult to understand customer behavior, manage contacts, and make data-driven decisions.

Core problem:

SMEs lack a simple, centralized solution that supports daily operations while helping them grow and engage customers effectively.
2. Why This Problem Matters

SMEs form the backbone of the economy, yet many:

Struggle to organize customer and business information

Rely on manual or fragmented systems

Have limited visibility into growth opportunities

Solving this problem can improve efficiency, revenue tracking, and customer relationships.

3. Using Data to Support Product Discovery

Before conducting interviews, I prepared a cleaned SME dataset to:

Identify active business categories

Ensure accurate contact information

Select a representative sample of SMEs for interviews

The dataset was not the end product, but a tool to enable better user research and problem validation.

4. User Interviews

Using the cleaned dataset, I conducted interviews across different SME categories such as:

Hair & beauty businesses

Restaurants

Retail and service-based SMEs

Interview focus areas:

Daily operational challenges

Customer communication and engagement

Current tools used (or lack thereof)

Pain points in growth and visibility

5. Key Insights from Interviews

Several recurring themes emerged:

Operational friction
SMEs manage operations manually, leading to errors and inefficiency.

Customer engagement challenges
Many businesses struggle to retain customers or communicate promotions consistently.

Limited digital tools
Existing tools are either too complex or not tailored to SME needs.

6. Refined Problem Statement
Based on user insights:

SMEs need a lightweight, easy-to-use platform that helps them manage operations and engage customers without complexity or high costs.

7. Product Vision

A simple, SME-focused platform that enables:

Business and customer contact management

Daily operational tracking

Customer engagement through basic outreach tools

Actionable insights to support growth

8. MVP Definition
Core MVP Features:

Centralized business & customer contacts

Simple dashboard for daily operations

Basic reporting (activity, customer engagement)

Easy onboarding for non-technical users

Features were prioritized based on user pain points and impact vs effort.

9. Key Product Decisions

Simplicity over feature richness

Mobile-friendly design

Low learning curve

Scalable foundation for future features

10. Next Steps

Validate MVP features with a second round of SME interviews

Build low-fidelity prototypes

Pilot with a small group of SMEs

Iterate based on feedback

11. Role & Skills Demonstrated

Product discovery & problem definition

User research & qualitative interviews

Data-supported decision making

MVP scoping & prioritization

12. Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how data-supported user research can drive meaningful product decisions. By focusing on real SME challenges, the product vision is grounded in validated user needs rather than assumptions.
